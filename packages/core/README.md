# @pigi/core

⚠️ **NOTICE** ⚠️

This is a WIP port of [`plasma-core`](https://github.com/plasma-group/plasma-core).

---

`@pigi/core` is the core of Plasma Group's client functionality.
It handles the basic functionality that all PG clients need to implement, like managing state updates and importing new transactions.

**Note**:
`@pigi/core` is **not** designed to be a full plasma client.
As a result, `@pigi/core` does not provide a graphical user interface or an easy way to interact with components.
If you're looking for a full client, check out [`@pigi/client`](https://github.com/plasma-group/pigi/tree/master/packages/client).
