Giving GitCoin Kudos
====================
This guide explains the process of giving `GitCoin Kudos`_.
Kudos are a great way to show your apprecation for fellow contributors.
Each Kudos is a unique `ERC-721`_ token on Ethereum.
Plasma Group only mints a limited number of Kudos at a time, so each one is special!

1. **Download or Log in to MetaMask.**

Kudos cost ETH to create.
This means you'll need an Ethereum wallet and some ETH in order to pay for the Kudos.
We're using `MetaMask`_ in this tutorial because it's super simple to set up.
If you've already got MetaMask installed, you'll need to log in.

Once you're logged in you should see something like this:

.. figure:: ../../_static/reference/gitcoin-kudos/metamask-login.png
    :align: center
    :target: ../../_static/reference/gitcoin-kudos/metamask-login.png

    MetaMask ready to go.

2. **Find your Kudos on the Kudos Marketplace.**

Once you've set up MetaMask, you're ready to find your Kudos!
Head over to the `Kudos Marketplace`_ where you'll find lots of different Kudos you can send.

Pick one you like and click it!
You should end up on a page like this:

.. figure:: ../../_static/reference/gitcoin-kudos/kudos-detail.png
    :align: center
    :target: ../../_static/reference/gitcoin-kudos/kudos-detail.png

    Very wow.

3. **Send the Kudos!**

Now you're at the fun part -- you get to send the Kudos!
Hit the "Send Kudos" button and you'll be sent to a page with a form.
Here you can type in the GitHub username of the contributor you'd like to send the Kudos to.
You can also add some additional information if you want.

Once you've filled out the form, hit the "Send" button!
If everything works out, you'll see a MetaMask popup:

.. figure:: ../../_static/reference/gitcoin-kudos/sending-kudos.png
    :align: center
    :target: ../../_static/reference/gitcoin-kudos/sending-kudos.png

    Thanks Karl.

This means you're going to make an Ethereum transaction to send the Kudos.
You can see the total estimated cost of the transaction in both ETH and USD.
If everything looks right, go ahead and hit "Confirm".

4. **Revel in the Glory of Kudos!**

That's it!
You've just sent your very first Kudos.
The recipient will get instructions via email explaining how to accept the Kudos.
Now you're ready to send your *second* Kudos ;-).
