Creating GitHub Issues
======================
If you're not familiar with GitHub, this is the place for you.
All of the work on Plasma Group happens on `our GitHub page`_.
GitHub is basically a website that allows people to store code online.

Note: this page is adapted from `earlier content written for LearnPlasma`_.

Issues 101
==========
A fundamental feature of GitHub is the ability to create new threads called **'issues'**.
Issues make it possible for anyone (including you!) to request new features, report bugs, or give general feedback.
For example, you can open a new issue if you spot a typo somewhere on these docs!

Your issues help us make Plasma Group projects better.
We want to make sure everything's working just as expected.
If anything doesn't seem to be working, please let us know!

Steps to Create an Issue
========================

1. **Head to the GitHub page**

You'll first want to `make a GitHub account`_ if you don't have one already.
Once you're ready to make your first issue, start by heading over to the `Plasma Group GitHub page`_.
You should see something like this:

.. figure:: ../../_static/reference/github-issues/github-page.png
    :align: center
    :target: ../../_static/reference/gitcoin-kudos/github-page.png

    The main Plasma Group GitHub repository.

Now, you'll want to click on the tab titled 'Issues'.
If you can't find the tab, you can get to the issues page directly by heading to this link: https://github.com/plasma-group/pigi/issues.

You should be on this page:

.. figure:: ../../_static/reference/github-issues/github-issues-page.png
    :align: center
    :target: ../../_static/reference/gitcoin-kudos/github-issues-page.png

    The issues page.

2. **Create the new issue.**

Click the green "New issue" button.
Here you'll be able to pick what type of issue you'd like to create (either a Bug Report or a Feature Request).
You can also click on "Open a regular issue" at the bottom if you want to create a different type of issue.

If all goes well, you'll end up on a page with a form where you can describe your issue:

.. figure:: ../../_static/reference/github-issues/github-issue-form.png
    :align: center
    :target: ../../_static/reference/gitcoin-kudos/github-issue-form.png

    Form for submitting new issues.

This form has room for two main components, the issue title and the issue body.
The issue title is the summary of your issue that other people will see on the "Issues" page.
You should try to keep this title as short and clear as possible!
Something short like "Typo in @pigi/core documentation" or "Bug when trying to install @pigi/client" quickly lets us know how to help.

The issue body is the main content of your issue.
Here, you'll want to fill in any relevant information to the issue at hand.
If you spot a typo, a link to the page with the typo would be much appreciated.
If you're requesting new feature or you find something confusing, a summary of what's unclear makes it easier to make changes.

Once you've filled in the relevant information, hit the "Submit new issue" button and you're done!
You've just submitted your first GitHub issue!
